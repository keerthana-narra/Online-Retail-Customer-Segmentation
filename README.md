## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION

1.1 Introduction to Customer Segmentation:
Customer segmentation is the process of categorizing a diverse customer base into distinct groups or segments based on certain shared characteristics, behaviors, or attributes. The aim is to identify patterns within the customer data that allow businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer experiences, and optimize their overall approach to different customer groups. This division enables companies to target their efforts more effectively, addressing the specific needs and preferences of each segment.
